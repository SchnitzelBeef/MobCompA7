# MobCompA7

Okay I've started in the PID class, but so far it doesn't relly do anything... At least anything correct.
The two files "PIDController.java" and "MobComp_Assignment07.java" are supposed to go in the results_MobComp_A07/jemula802/src/layer2_802Algorithms folder to be actually used.
It will print "This is station 1. MODIFIED MobComp algorithm: 'MobComp_Assignment07'." if the correct algorithm is used for simualtion
                                  ^^ 
Sorry for the mess, but I have no time left. (Actually going on a date now so wish me lucK!)
And good luck to you, will be back to work on it tonight a bit.
